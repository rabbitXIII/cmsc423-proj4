proj4_rgopal.pl 	This is my submission for the project.

For everything all inclusive:

This assumes that the following utilities from Amos are in the same directory as the project script.

To Run the Project:

./proj4_rgopal.pl [sequences fasta] [hoxd2 file] [output ovl] [gap_start] [gap_extend] [minimum idenitity%] [min overlap between seqeunces] [max hang]


For example:

./proj4_rgopal.pl ../amos/small/crp177.seq ../cmsc423-proj3/testcases/HOXD2.txt my_output.ovl -2000 -200 98 45 60

If you so choose, you can also run the script with only the first three fields. The default values will
kick in as follows:

gap_start	-2000
gap_extend	-200
min identity%	98
min overlap	45
max hang	60	


This script is VERY slow... the SW Algorithm is likely very slow and needs to be optimized
and some of the data structures are used out of convenience, but could impact performance
 It doesn't help that perl isn't too quick either.
